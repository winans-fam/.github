## Reporting a Vulnerability

:wave: Hiyo! I'm [@solvaholic], thank you for reading this policy.

If you've found a security vulnerability in any of the [repositories under github.com/winans-fam], I would very much like to help ensure no one suffers from it.

If you think it's something someone else should take care of, please speak with them about it. [@mention] me in the issue, if I can help.

If you think it's something I should take care of, or if you'd like me to help you find the appropriate audience, please [raise an issue in solvaholic/solvaholic] about it.

In case you'd prefer to speak with me directly, you can reach me [on Keybase]. I watch for notifications from GitHub and Keybase. I don't do email.
