# Support Policy

This is [the **winans-fam** organization]'s default support policy, for [repositories under github.com/winans-fam].

## Asking for help

:wave: Hiyo! I'm [@solvaholic], thank you for reading this policy.

[Repositories under github.com/winans-fam] are use-at-your-own-risk and are (or should be) documented as such.

That said, if you want to use something I've worked on then I want you to have a good experience with it. If you have questions or find a problem, please create or update an issue in the project's repository.

Each project has its own README. That document should help you see what to expect from the project and how to use it. If the README, or any of the **winans-fam** projects' documentation, fail to help you see what to expect from the project and how to use it, please use an issue to let me know.

Since you're reading the _Support Policy_ I assume you're not looking for a tip jar or a way to say, "Thanks!". In case I'm mistaken about that, please share your appreciation in an issue or by [starring] the repository. :bow:

In case you'd prefer to speak with me directly, you can reach me [on Keybase]. I watch for notifications from GitHub and Keybase. I don't do email.
